## Project Synopsis  

### Problem Statement  
Ethiopia’s healthcare system struggles with:  
- **Fragmented patient records** across hospitals.  
- **No centralized system** to access medical history.  
- **Identity verification challenges** during emergencies.  

### Planned Solution  
MedFayda solves this by:  
- **Fayda ID authentication** (OIDC integration) for secure login.  
- **Unified health records** linked to Fayda IDs.  
- **Real-time access** for doctors with patient consent.  
- **SMS fallback** for areas with poor internet.  

### Expected Outcome  
- **30% faster diagnosis** with instant record access.  
- **Reduced duplicate tests**, saving costs.  
- **Secure, nationwide scalability** via Fayda.  

### Fayda’s Role  
- **Primary identity verification** (government-backed trust).  
- **OIDC integration** for seamless authentication.  
- **Compliance** with national digital ID standards.
